        <p>My name is Stephanie Palese and I was born in raised in Sewell, NJ. I attended Clearview high school where I graduated second in my class while participating in track and field.</p>
        <p>When I graduated, I then enrolled and attended the University of Delware to pursue a degree in Nutrition and Dietetics.</p>
        <p>After my freshmen year, I joined the cross country team and became a captain as a walk on. I was able to travel the country and compete against some of the countries best collegiate athletes.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I decided to pursue my career in teaching, so that meant that I had to go back to school and get my masters in Mathematics.</p>
        <p>Now, I am a math teacher at Haddon Township High. Tutoring has become a passion of mine because I can help students who are looking to get ahead, or are struggling with their course work.</p>
