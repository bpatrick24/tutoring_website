      <div class="bio">
        <p>My name is Stephanie Palese and I was born in raised in Sewell, NJ. I attended Clearview high school where I graduated second in my class while participating in track and field.</p>
        <p>When I graduated, I then enrolled and attended the University of Delware to pursue a degree in Nutrition and Dietetics.</p>
        <p>After my freshmen year, I joined the cross country team and became a captain as a walk on. I was able to travel the country and compete against some of the countries best collegiate athletes.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I decided to pursue my career in teaching, so that meant that I had to go back to school and get my masters in Mathematics.</p>
        <p>Now, I am a math teacher at Haddon Township High. Tutoring has become a passion of mine because I can help students who are looking to get ahead, or are struggling with their course work.</p>

        <h2>Algebra</h2>
        <img src="/resources/algebra.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>Inequalities, functions, and graphs. Oh my! Algebra is hard for students because we assume we are learning new information, when we are actually putting language to concrete ideas we already know to be true from experience. Algebra becomes hard when we start down the path of memorization and speed; instead, students need to slow down to fully understand and master foundational concepts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subj-container">
        <h2>Geometry</h2>
        <img src="./resources/geometry.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>Geometry is hard because most math doesn't teach kids spatial thinking. Instead, they need to learn geometrical concepts with ease. Proofs are a hard topic to get into, and everyone struggles with it. Kids need to understand that everyone suffers from this topic, even the most mathematically gifted ones.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subj-container">
        <h2>Calculus</h2>
        <img src="./resources/calculus.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
        <p>Calculus is widely regarded as a very hard math class, and with good reason. The concepts take you far beyond the comfortable realms of algebra and geometry that you've explored in previous courses. Calculus asks you to think in ways that are more abstract, requiring more imagination.</p>

        <h3>Do you tutor virtual or in-person?</h3>
        <p>I am available for both in-person tutoring and virtual tutoring. I highly recommend in person tutoring because that tends to yield better content retention.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Do you tutor any other related subjects?</h3>
        <p>I have tutored physics in the past, but typially no. I mainly stick to math related subjects.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Can you tutor my child if they are currently your student?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, no. That would give your child an unfair advantage and go against Haddon Township Highs academic honesty policy.</p>
